The McGill Planar Hydrogen Atmosphere Code (McPHAC)


To compile, make any needed changes to 'Makefile', and then type 'make
McPHAC'.

McPHAC takes commonly changed physical and computational parameters as
input arguments, and for convenience these can be set in in the script
'McPHAC.bash', which then allows running McPHAC with "./McPHAC.bash".

Each function is contained in a separate file named after that
function, with the exception of 'McPHAC.c', which contains main().
